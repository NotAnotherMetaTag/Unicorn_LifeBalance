	    <p>Welcome to Team Unicorn's webpage for CS 344 at Winona State University, Spring 2018. This webpage will focus on how to identify the stress in one's life, how to handle it, and how to prevent it. We have provided multiple resources, from online videos, images, and external links to assist one with completing this goal.</p>
		
	    <p>You can navigate our page via the links at the top, placed within our banner. The page is still under construction at this time.</p>
	    
		<p>It should be noted that we are not professionals in this regard, and if you feel genuinely overwhelmed, overworked, or feel alone, there are professional resources that can be reached. If you are employed, look into your company's provided benefits for consultations and therapy. Other options include looking into local private practice as well as clinic physicians. Stress can affect both your emotional and physical health and it is important to take warning signs seriously. Do not be afraid to reach out when you need it.</p>
