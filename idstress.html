        Identifying Stress Triggers:<br/><br/>
        
	Self-reflection can be incredibly difficult for a lot of people, and it can be even harder when you find yourself in a situation where you need to be focused on what you are doing or what is happening around you, and not on how you are feeling. Even when you find yourself able, you may not be able to know what is or is not normal. 
	But that is why we are here! To help you navigate through a sea of emotions in this constantly rolling world. <br/>
	There are a multitude of signs to be looking out for and they don't always mean that you or anyone else are unhealthily stressed; Psychological, Emotional, Physical, or Behavioral changes to your every day habits can be signs of stress. <br/>
	To list a few of the items under each of these categories...<br/>
	Psychological:<br/>
	A lack of concentration<br/>
	Constant negative emotions<br/>
	Becoming vague<br/>
	Intuition misfiring<br/>
	Emotional:<br/>
	Obscurely tearful<br/>
	Irritable<br/>
	Mood swings in general<br/>
	Defensive and sensitivity to criticism<br/>
	Lack of motivation<br/>
	Anger and temperment<br/>
	Physical:<br/>
	Aches and pains<br/>
	Teeth grinding<br/>
	Frequently getting sick; colds, IBS, fevers<br/>
	Rapid weight loss or gain<br/>
	Behavioral:<br/>
	Never taking time to relax<br/>
	Accident prone, clumsy<br/>
	Increased alcohol or other drug use<br/>
	Isolation<br/>
	Aggressiveness<br/><br/>
	
	These are just a handful of notable items to be on the lookout for, but all of them center around a single idea: Sudden difference in personality. <br/>
	Stress makes you change who you are in an attempt to accomodate the extra pressure.<br/> 
	If you are uncertain about the level of stress in your life, a good tool to get you into the habit of noticing these changes arise is a journal. Simply taking the time to write down how you feel throughout the day will give you access and understanding of your emotions. 
	Once you have identified your stressors, it's a matter of handling them, which will be covered on a separate page. 
	And just for fun, here's a handy video that's part of a series of videos on stress to help give a visual aid to this lesson:<br/><br/>
